Sure! Let's break down the process into detailed steps for automating the creation of new matter sites and creating custom forms for document management in SharePoint using Power Apps and Power Automate.

### 1. Automated Matter Site Creation

#### Step 1: Create a Power App

1. **Open Power Apps**:
   - Go to Power Apps and sign in with your Microsoft account.

2. **Create a New App**:
   - Click on **Create** > **Canvas app from blank**.
   - Name your app (e.g., "Matter Site Creator") and choose the layout (Tablet or Phone).

3. **Design the App**:
   - Add input fields for the necessary information (e.g., Client Name, Matter Type).
   - Add a button to trigger the site creation process.

#### Step 2: Build a Power Automate Flow

1. **Create a New Flow**:
   - Go to Power Automate and sign in.
   - Click on **Create** > **Automated flow**.

2. **Set the Trigger**:
   - Choose **PowerApps** as the trigger.

3. **Add Actions to Create the Site**:
   - Add the **Send an HTTP request to SharePoint** action.
   - Configure the action to create a new site. Hereâ€™s an example of the JSON body:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "Title": "@{triggerBody()?['ClientName']} - @{triggerBody()?['MatterType']}",
    "Url": "https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/@{triggerBody()?['ClientName']}-@{triggerBody()?['MatterType']}",
    "Lcid": 1033,
    "ShareByEmailEnabled": false,
    "Description": "Site for @{triggerBody()?['ClientName']} - @{triggerBody()?['MatterType']}",
    "WebTemplate": "STS#3",
    "Owner": "owner@yourdomain.com"
  }
}
```

4. **Populate the Site**:
   - Add actions to create document libraries, calendars, and tasks.
   - Use the **Send an HTTP request to SharePoint** action to set permissions.

5. **Apply a Site Template**:
   - If you have a site design template, use the template ID in your flow to apply it to the new site.

#### Step 3: Connect Power App to Power Automate

1. **Add a Flow to the Button**:
   - In Power Apps, select the button you added earlier.
   - Go to the **Action** tab and select **Power Automate**.
   - Choose the flow you created and configure it to pass the input fields (Client Name, Matter Type) to the flow.

### 2. Custom Forms for Document Management

#### Step 1: Design Custom Forms in Power Apps

1. **Create a New Form**:
   - In Power Apps, create a new form with fields for metadata (e.g., Document Type, Client Name, Case Number).

2. **Add a Submit Button**:
   - Add a button to submit the form and trigger a Power Automate flow.

#### Step 2: Build a Power Automate Flow for Document Submission

1. **Create a New Flow**:
   - Go to Power Automate and create a new flow with **PowerApps** as the trigger.

2. **Add Actions to Upload the Document**:
   - Use the **Create file** action to upload the document to the appropriate document library.
   - Use the **Update file properties** action to set metadata.

3. **Trigger Workflows**:
   - Add actions to start specific workflows based on the document type or other criteria.

### Example Power Automate Flow for Document Submission

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "PowerApps"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "CreateFile",
      "library": "Documents",
      "fileName": "@{triggerBody()?['FileName']}",
      "fileContent": "@{triggerBody()?['FileContent']}"
    },
    {
      "type": "UpdateFileProperties",
      "library": "Documents",
      "fileName": "@{triggerBody()?['FileName']}",
      "metadata": {
        "ClientName": "@{triggerBody()?['ClientName']}",
        "CaseNumber": "@{triggerBody()?['CaseNumber']}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "StartWorkflow",
      "workflowName": "DocumentApproval",
      "parameters": {
        "DocumentID": "@{triggerBody()?['DocumentID']}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
