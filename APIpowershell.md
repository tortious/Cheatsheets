Automating SharePoint Embedded: Using PowerShell to Call Graph API Endpoints
Automating SharePoint Embedded: Using PowerShell to Call Graph API Endpoints
1. Introduction

In the modern digital landscape, organizations are constantly seeking ways to streamline their workflows and automate repetitive tasks. SharePoint, a robust platform for content management and collaboration, often plays a central role in these processes. While SharePoint provides a rich user interface and a powerful API for interacting with its data, there are times when a more programmatic approach is needed. This is where leveraging PowerShell to call the Microsoft Graph API comes into play.

By using PowerShell, we can access and manipulate SharePoint data directly from scripts, automating tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention. This approach can be especially valuable for:

    Bulk Operations: Creating, updating, or deleting large numbers of SharePoint items.
    Customizations: Extending SharePoint functionality beyond its built-in capabilities.
    Integration: Connecting SharePoint with other systems and applications.
    Administration: Managing SharePoint environments, such as user provisioning and site creation.

This article delves into the world of automating SharePoint through PowerShell and the Microsoft Graph API. We’ll explore the essential concepts, practical use cases, and step-by-step examples to empower you to harness this powerful combination.
2. Key Concepts, Techniques, and Tools
2.1. Microsoft Graph API

The Microsoft Graph API is a RESTful web API that provides access to data across various Microsoft cloud services, including SharePoint. It allows developers and administrators to programmatically interact with data like users, groups, sites, lists, files, and more.
2.2. PowerShell

PowerShell is a scripting language and command-line shell developed by Microsoft. It excels at automating tasks, managing systems, and interacting with APIs. PowerShell is an ideal tool for working with the Microsoft Graph API, as it provides robust features for making HTTP requests, parsing JSON responses, and manipulating data.
2.3. OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows applications to access protected resources on behalf of a user without requiring the user’s credentials. In the context of the Microsoft Graph API, OAuth 2.0 is used to authenticate and authorize PowerShell scripts to interact with SharePoint data.
2.4. Azure AD App Registration

To use OAuth 2.0 with the Microsoft Graph API, you need to register an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This process generates an application ID (client ID) and a secret key (client secret), which are required for obtaining access tokens.
2.5. Access Tokens

Access tokens are short-lived credentials that grant an application permission to access specific resources. PowerShell scripts use the application ID and client secret to obtain access tokens from Azure AD, which are then used to authenticate requests to the Microsoft Graph API.
3. Practical Use Cases and Benefits
