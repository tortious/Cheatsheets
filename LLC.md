Registering an LLC in Illinois for your SEO consulting business involves several steps. Here’s a complete breakdown of what you’ll need to do:

⸻

1. Choose a Business Name
	•	The name must be unique and not already registered with the Illinois Secretary of State.
	•	It must include “Limited Liability Company” or an abbreviation like LLC or L.L.C..
	•	Avoid restricted words like “corporation,” “bank,” or “insurance” unless you get special permission.
	•	Check name availability using the Illinois Secretary of State Business Entity Search and ensure the .com domain is available if you plan to create a website.

⸻

2. Designate a Registered Agent
	•	Your LLC must have a registered agent in Illinois to receive legal documents.
	•	The agent must be an Illinois resident or a business entity authorized to operate in Illinois.
	•	You can be your own registered agent if you have a physical Illinois address (not a P.O. box), or you can hire a service (costs ~$50–$150/year).

⸻

3. File Articles of Organization
	•	Submit Form LLC-5.5 (Articles of Organization) with the Illinois Secretary of State.
	•	You can file online via CyberDrive Illinois or by mail.
	•	Filing fee: $150 (plus a 2.35% processing fee if paying online).
	•	Expedited processing (24 hours): $100 extra.

⸻

4. Create an Operating Agreement (Optional but Recommended)
	•	Illinois does not require an Operating Agreement, but it’s crucial for structuring your business.
	•	It outlines ownership percentages, decision-making processes, profit/loss distribution, and exit strategies.
	•	This helps prevent disputes if you have partners.
	•	You can draft one yourself or use a legal service like Rocket Lawyer or LegalZoom.

⸻

5. Obtain an EIN from the IRS
	•	Employer Identification Number (EIN) is required if you:
	•	Plan to hire employees.
	•	Want to open a business bank account.
	•	Need to file business taxes.
	•	Apply online for free at the IRS website.

⸻

6. Register for Illinois State Taxes
	•	If you sell taxable goods or services, register for sales tax via the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR).
	•	If you have employees, you need to register for:
	•	Illinois Unemployment Insurance Tax.
	•	Illinois Withholding Tax.
	•	SEO consulting is usually not subject to sales tax, but confirm with IDOR.

⸻

7. Obtain Business Licenses & Permits (If Required)
	•	Illinois does not require a general business license, but you should:
	•	Check local city/county requirements.
	•	If working from home, ensure zoning laws allow a home-based business.
	•	No special licenses are required for SEO consulting.

⸻

8. Open a Business Bank Account
	•	Keep business and personal finances separate to maintain liability protection.
	•	Requirements:
	•	EIN
	•	LLC formation documents
	•	Operating Agreement (sometimes required)
	•	Consider business credit cards and accounting software (QuickBooks, Wave, etc.).

⸻

9. Register for Business Insurance (Optional but Recommended)
	•	General Liability Insurance: Protects against lawsuits and damages.
	•	Professional Liability Insurance (Errors & Omissions): Covers legal claims related to SEO services.
	•	Business Owner’s Policy (BOP): Bundles general liability and property insurance.

⸻

10. Set Up Business Accounting & Taxes
	•	Track income/expenses using:
	•	QuickBooks
	•	Wave
	•	FreshBooks
	•	Tax Considerations:
	•	LLCs default to pass-through taxation (profits are taxed on your personal return).
	•	Consider electing S-Corp status if making $80K+ in net profit to save on self-employment taxes.
	•	Pay estimated quarterly taxes to the IRS and Illinois Department of Revenue.

⸻

11. Build Your Business Presence
	•	Website: Secure a domain & hosting.
	•	Social Media: Create business profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.
	•	Google My Business: Helps local SEO and credibility.
