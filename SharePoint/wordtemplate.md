Creating a template for a legal pleading in Office 365 Business Standard is a great way to streamline your workflow. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up in Microsoft Word:

1. **Open Microsoft Word**:
   - Launch Microsoft Word from your Office 365 suite.

2. **Create a New Document**:
   - Go to **File** > **New**.
   - In the search bar, type "pleading" to see if there are any pre-made templates available. If not, you can create one from scratch.

3. **Set Up the Document Layout**:
   - Go to **Layout** > **Margins** and set the margins according to your court’s requirements.
   - Use **Insert** > **Header** to add a header for your pleading paper. This typically includes the court name, case number, and other relevant information.

4. **Add Placeholder Text**:
   - Type out the standard text for your pleading, leaving placeholders for variable information (e.g., [Plaintiff], [Defendant], [Case Number]).
   - You can format these placeholders with bold or brackets to make them easily identifiable.

5. **Use Content Controls**:
   - Go to **Developer** tab (if it’s not visible, enable it via **File** > **Options** > **Customize Ribbon** and check **Developer**).
   - Use **Rich Text Content Control** or **Plain Text Content Control** to insert fields where you can plug in information. These controls allow you to easily fill in the necessary details later.

6. **Save as a Template**:
   - Once your document is set up, save it as a template by going to **File** > **Save As**.
   - Choose **Word Template (*.dotx)** from the file type dropdown.

7. **Using the Template**:
   - Whenever you need to create a new pleading, go to **File** > **New** and select your saved template. Fill in the placeholders with the relevant information.
