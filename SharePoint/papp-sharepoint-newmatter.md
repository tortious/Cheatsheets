Yes, you can use Power Apps and SharePoint to create a system that will store information for each open legal matter, including calendars, case numbers, parties involved, and more. This system will also allow you to enter new information or open up new matters. Here's how you can create such a system:

### **1. Setting Up the SharePoint Lists**
First, you'll need to set up SharePoint to store the data for each legal matter. This involves creating SharePoint lists for the different types of information you need to track.

1. **Create a SharePoint Site:**
   - Start by creating a new SharePoint site specifically for your legal matters, such as “Legal Matters Management.”
   
2. **Create SharePoint Lists:**
   - **Matters List:** This list will store the main details about each matter (e.g., Case Number, Case Name, Parties Involved, Matter Status).
   - **Parties List:** A separate list to manage the parties involved in each matter (e.g., Party Name, Role, Contact Information).
   - **Calendar List:** You can use SharePoint’s built-in calendar or create a custom list to track important dates and deadlines for each matter (e.g., hearing dates, filing deadlines).
   - **Tasks List:** A list for tracking tasks related to each matter (e.g., task description, due date, assigned to).
   - **Documents Library:** Set up a document library to store all related documents. Use metadata to tag each document with the relevant matter.

### **2. Building the Power App**
Next, you'll build a Power App that connects to your SharePoint lists. The app will allow you to view, edit, and add new matters and related information.

1. **Create a New Canvas App in Power Apps:**
   - Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) and select **Create** > **Canvas app from blank**.
   - Name your app (e.g., “Legal Matters Tracker”) and choose the layout (tablet or phone).

2. **Connect to SharePoint:**
   - In Power Apps, go to **Data** > **Add Data** and select SharePoint.
   - Connect to the SharePoint site you created and select the lists you want to use in your app (e.g., Matters, Parties, Calendar, Tasks).

3. **Design the User Interface:**
   - **Home Screen:** Create a home screen that displays all active matters using a gallery control connected to your Matters list.
     - Allow users to search for specific matters or filter by status.
     - Add buttons for adding a new matter or viewing details of an existing matter.
   - **Matter Detail Screen:** When a user selects a matter, navigate to a detail screen displaying all relevant information, including related parties, upcoming dates, tasks, and documents.
     - Use form controls bound to the selected matter to display and allow editing of information.
   - **New Matter Form:** Create a form for users to enter information when opening a new matter. The form should populate the Matters list in SharePoint.

4. **Linking Related Information:**
   - For each matter, allow users to add related parties, calendar events, tasks, and documents. Use lookup fields in your SharePoint lists to associate this data with the correct matter.
   - In Power Apps, use dropdowns or combo boxes to select related parties or tasks linked to a specific matter.

5. **Automation with Power Automate (Optional):**
   - Use Power Automate to automate common workflows, such as sending
