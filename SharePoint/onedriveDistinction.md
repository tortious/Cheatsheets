It sounds like you're trying to distinguish between:

1. **Your "Personal Work OneDrive"** (the storage space associated with your business account that’s personal to you but managed by the company), and
2. **The "Work OneDrive"** (shared document libraries or storage spaces that belong to teams or departments within your company, typically stored in SharePoint).

### How to Distinguish Between the Two:

#### 1. **Personal Work OneDrive (My Files under OneDrive for Business)**:
- **What it is**: This is your individual cloud storage under your work account. It’s like your personal drive within the company’s Microsoft 365 environment. You can store work-related files here, but it’s not for sharing by default unless you manually share files or folders with colleagues.
- **Where you see it**: In **OneDrive – [Your Company Name]**.
- **In File Explorer**: You will find this under the folder named **OneDrive – [Your Company Name]**, and inside it, you'll see a folder like "My files" or other folders you've created for personal work use.
- **Who controls it**: While this is your space, it’s part of your company’s environment, meaning your company can enforce retention policies, compliance checks, and security measures.

#### 2. **Work OneDrive (Shared Document Libraries)**:
- **What it is**: This is shared cloud storage used for collaborative work. It's tied to **SharePoint document libraries** or **Teams** where multiple people have access to files. These are commonly organized by department, project, or team.
- **Where you see it**: These are stored under **SharePoint** or **Shared Libraries** in **OneDrive** or Microsoft Teams.
- **In File Explorer**: If you’ve synced any shared document libraries, they will appear as separate locations under the **OneDrive – [Your Company Name]** section, but they’ll have the name of the shared library (like **Marketing Documents** or **Project Files**). These are not part of your personal storage.
- **Who controls it**: These files are typically managed at the company or team level. You and your colleagues can collaborate on them.

### Example of Folder Structure in File Explorer

- **OneDrive – [Your Company Name]**
  - **My Files** (This is your personal work OneDrive space. You can use it for personal work storage, but it's managed by your company).
  - **Marketing Documents** (or any shared library; this is a Work OneDrive space that multiple people have access to).

### Visual Differences:
- **My Files (Personal Work OneDrive)**: Will generally only be accessible by you unless you manually share files.
- **Shared Libraries (Work OneDrive)**: Created by teams or departments, often labeled with the team name or project.

### How to View and Access Them:
1. **In OneDrive on the Web**:
   - Log into your Microsoft 365 account and open **OneDrive**.
   - On the left, you’ll see:
     - **My Files** (This is your personal work OneDrive space).
     - **Shared** (This includes files shared with you and any shared document libraries).
     - **Shared libraries** (These are your work’s SharePoint libraries).

2. **In File Explorer**:
   - **OneDrive – [Your Company Name]** (this folder contains both your personal files and any shared document libraries you’ve synced).
   - The difference lies in whether you're looking at "My Files" (personal) vs. a shared document library.

### Practical Example
- **Your Personal Work OneDrive** might have folders like "Draft Reports" or "Personal Work Notes" – files you use and manage personally.
- **The Work OneDrive (Shared Libraries)** might have folders like "Client Contracts" or "Team Documents" – shared spaces that are typically used by a whole team.
