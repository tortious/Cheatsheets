As a **Global Admin** in Microsoft 365, you have **broad administrative rights** across the tenant, which includes managing user accounts, security settings, and organizational policies. However, when it comes to **SharePoint and OneDrive document libraries**, your access isn't always automatic by default for every file or site. Here's how it works:

### Access for Global Admins:
1. **Tenant-Wide Administrative Permissions**:
   - As a Global Admin, you have the ability to **manage settings and permissions** for SharePoint and OneDrive at the organizational level.
   - You can change settings like external sharing, document retention, and permission structures.

2. **Site and Document Library Access**:
   - **However, Global Admins do not automatically have access to the contents** of all SharePoint sites, document libraries, or OneDrive folders. Each site or library has its own permissions, which must be specifically granted to users or groups.
   - By default, you won't see the contents of a SharePoint site or document library unless:
     - You are added as a **Site Owner** or granted permissions to that site.
     - You use your Global Admin rights to **take control of the site** by adding yourself to the site's permissions.

### How to Access Specific Sites or Libraries:
If you want access to a particular SharePoint site or OneDrive for Business folder as a Global Admin, you can manually add yourself using your admin privileges.

#### For SharePoint Sites:
1. **SharePoint Admin Center**:
   - Go to the **SharePoint Admin Center** in Microsoft 365.
   - Find the specific **site collection** (modern SharePoint sites) or **classic site** you want to access.
   - Click on the site, and under **Permissions**, you can either:
     - **Add yourself** as a Site Owner or Site Member.
     - Manage permissions to give yourself or your group full control.

2. **Direct Site Permissions**:
   - Navigate directly to the SharePoint site you need access to.
   - If you're blocked, you can go to the **Site Permissions** settings (you'll have the option to take ownership or grant yourself access using your Global Admin credentials).

#### For OneDrive for Business (User's Files):
1. **OneDrive Admin Center**:
   - In the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**, go to the **OneDrive Admin Center**.
   - You can assign yourself (or another admin) permission to access a user’s OneDrive files by taking ownership temporarily or assigning administrative rights.

2. **Take Control of a User's OneDrive**:
   - Navigate to **Users > Active Users** in the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.
   - Select the user whose OneDrive you need to access, and you’ll see an option to manage their OneDrive under the **OneDrive settings**.
   - Click **Create link to files** or **Access files**, which will give you administrative access to their OneDrive documents.

### Should You Add Yourself Everywhere?
You only need to add yourself to specific sites or libraries when you need access. It's generally not necessary (or advisable) to add yourself to every library unless there's a specific need.
