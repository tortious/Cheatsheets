To create SharePoint sites for each item in a list and name the sites based on the “Case Name” parameter, you can automate this process using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) or PowerShell with the SharePoint REST API. Below is a breakdown of both methods:

### Method 1: **Using Power Automate**

Power Automate is a user-friendly way to automate this task without needing deep programming knowledge. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Steps:
1. **Create a Power Automate Flow:**
   - Go to **Power Automate** (https://flow.microsoft.com/).
   - Click **Create** and select **Automated flow**.

2. **Trigger:**
   - Choose **When an item is created or modified** as the trigger.
   - Select the SharePoint site and list where the “Case Name” parameter is stored.

3. **Get the Case Name:**
   - Use the **Get Item** action to retrieve the item's details, including the "Case Name" field.

4. **Create a SharePoint Site:**
   - Add a **Send an HTTP request to SharePoint** action to create a SharePoint site for each new list item.
   - Use the following REST API URL to create a modern SharePoint site:
     ```
     POST https://<tenant-name>.sharepoint.com/_api/SPSiteManager/create
     ```
   - Set the headers:
     - `Accept`: `application/json;odata=verbose`
     - `Content-Type`: `application/json`

   - In the body, include the details for the new site, with the title being the "Case Name" from the list item:
     ```json
     {
       "request": {
         "Title": "@{triggerOutputs()?['body/CaseName']}",
         "Url": "sites/@{triggerOutputs()?['body/CaseName'].replace(' ', '')}",
         "Lcid": 1033,
         "ShareByEmailEnabled": false,
         "WebTemplate": "STS#3",
         "Description": "Site for case: @{triggerOutputs()?['body/CaseName']}",
         "SiteDesignId": "6154c1ee-bcc5-4a04-b5b6-42bcbccab7ff"
       }
     }
     ```
     - The `Url` will be the site URL, derived from the "Case Name" (with spaces removed).
     - The `WebTemplate` is for a team site (you can modify this for other types of sites).
     - You can also include a `SiteDesignId` to apply a custom design, if you have one.

5. **Error Handling (Optional):**
   - Add error handling to deal with any site creation failures (e.g., duplicate site names, permission issues).

6. **Test and Run:**
   - Save the flow and test it by creating or modifying an item in the list. The flow should trigger, retrieve the "Case Name," and create a SharePoint site with that name.

### Method 2: **Using PowerShell (PnP PowerShell)**

If you prefer to use PowerShell and are comfortable with scripting, you can use PnP PowerShell to automate site creation.

#### Steps:
1. **Install PnP PowerShell:**
   - Install the PnP PowerShell module if you don’t have it:
     ```powershell
     Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell
     ```

2. **Connect to SharePoint:**
   - Connect to your SharePoint Online environment:
     ```powershell
     Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://<tenant-name>.sharepoint.com" -Interactive
     ```

3. **Get List Items:**
   - Retrieve all items from the list where the "Case Name" is stored:
     ```powershell
     $listItems = Get-PnPListItem -List "Cases"
     ```

4. **Create a SharePoint Site for Each Case:**
   - Loop through each list item and create a site based on the "Case Name":
     ```powershell
     foreach ($item in $listItems) {
         $caseName = $item["CaseName"]
         $siteUrl = "https://<tenant-name>.sharepoint.com/sites/$($caseName.Replace(' ',''))"

         # Create a new site using the 'STS#3' template (modern team site)
         New-PnPSite -Type TeamSite -Title $caseName -Alias $caseName.Replace(' ','') -IsPublic $false
         
         Write-Host "Site created for case: $caseName at $siteUrl"
     }
     ```

5. **Test and Run:**
   - Run the script, and it will create new sites for each item in the list based on the "Case Name" field.

### Considerations:
- **Naming Conventions:** Ensure that the "Case Name" does not contain special characters that are not allowed in SharePoint URLs (like `#`, `%`, `&`, etc.). You may need to sanitize the "Case Name" before using it in the URL.
- **Permissions:** You may need to set permissions for each site after creating it, depending on your firm's access control requirements.

Would you prefer using Power Automate or PowerShell for this? Or do you need further customization?
