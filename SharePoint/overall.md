Creating a case dashboard in SharePoint for your law firm can help centralize case information, track progress, and monitor key metrics. Given your firm’s civil defense practice and specific setup, I’ll walk you through building a customizable case dashboard using SharePoint. The dashboard can display case details, upcoming events, status updates, and more.

### Steps to Create a Case Dashboard in SharePoint

#### 1. **Set Up a SharePoint Site for the Dashboard**
   - **Create a New Site:**
     If you haven't done so already, create a dedicated SharePoint site for your dashboard. This can be a **Team Site** or a **Communication Site**, depending on your needs:
     - **Team Site**: Good for collaboration within your law firm (staff, attorney).
     - **Communication Site**: Best if you want the dashboard primarily for viewing and reporting.
   
   - Go to SharePoint, click **Create Site**, and choose the appropriate type.
   
#### 2. **Create Custom Lists for Cases, Tasks, and Events**
   You’ll need a way to store and manage your case data. SharePoint **Lists** are perfect for this.

   - **Case List**:
     - Create a custom list called **Cases** to store basic case details.
     - Columns to include:
       - **Case Name**: Single line of text.
       - **Client Name**: Lookup field (or Single line of text).
       - **Case Status**: Choice (Open, Closed, In Progress, etc.).
       - **Assigned Attorney**: Person or Group field.
       - **Case Start Date**: Date field.
       - **Case End Date**: Date field (optional).
       - **Key Notes**: Multi-line text for general case notes.
       - **Case Type**: Choice (civil defense categories like personal injury, insurance, etc.).

   - **Task List**:
     - Create a list for case-related tasks. Call it **Case Tasks**.
     - Columns to include:
       - **Task Name**: Single line of text.
       - **Assigned To**: Person or Group field.
       - **Due Date**: Date field.
       - **Status**: Choice (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
       - **Related Case**: Lookup field (lookup to the Cases list).
       - **Priority**: Choice (Low, Medium, High).

   - **Events List**:
     - For tracking deadlines, hearings, or other significant events, create an **Events** list.
     - Columns to include:
       - **Event Name**: Single line of text.
       - **Event Date**: Date field.
       - **Case**: Lookup field (lookup to the Cases list).
       - **Event Type**: Choice (Hearing, Filing Deadline, etc.).
       - **Assigned Attorney**: Person or Group field.

#### 3. **Add Case Dashboard Elements**
   Use **SharePoint web parts** to display and organize the data from your lists.

   - **Add a Page for the Dashboard**:
     - In your SharePoint site, go to the **Site Contents** page.
     - Click on **Pages**, then **New** to create a new page.
     - Choose a layout that fits your needs (e.g., a two-column layout to separate key metrics and task lists).

   - **Add Web Parts**:
     Web parts allow you to display the lists and data on your dashboard.
   
     - **List Web Part**:
       - Add a **List** web part for each of the lists you’ve created (Cases, Case Tasks, and Events).
       - Configure filters to show the most relevant data, e.g., upcoming deadlines or open cases.

     - **Task Progress View**:
       - Add a **List** web part to show tasks filtered by status (e.g., tasks not started or in progress). You can create a custom view of the **Case Tasks** list to filter by assigned staff or case.
       - Use **Group by Case** to see tasks related to each case.
   
     - **Calendar Web Part**:
       - Add a **Calendar** web part for the **Events** list. This will give a visual timeline of hearings, deadlines, and other key dates.
   
     - **Quick Links**:
       - Add a **Quick Links** web part to include links to other important resources, like documents, research notes, or specific case folders in SharePoint.
   
     - **Chart or Graph (Optional)**:
       - Use the **Power BI web part** to display visual metrics, such as the number of cases by type or task completion status. You’ll need to connect Power BI to your SharePoint data for this.

#### 4. **Custom Views and Filters**
   - **Custom Views**:
     - In your **Cases** list, create custom views such as:
       - **Active Cases**: Filter where **Case Status** = Open or In Progress.
       - **Upcoming Deadlines**: Filter your **Events** list to show only events within the next 7 or 30 days.
       - **Tasks by Priority**: In your **Case Tasks** list, create a view that shows tasks sorted by priority.

   - **Grouping**:
     - You can group tasks by **Related Case** or by **Assigned To** so that it’s easy to see how work is distributed among your staff.

#### 5. **Automation with Power Automate**
   - **Notifications**: You can automate reminders and notifications using **Power Automate**. For instance, create a flow to notify attorneys when a task is nearing its due date or when a case status is updated.
   - **Task Updates**: Automatically update case statuses based on task completion, or send daily or weekly summaries of outstanding tasks.

#### 6. **Integrating Documents**
   If you manage case documents in SharePoint document libraries, you can link the **Documents** web part to the case dashboard to show the most recent documents or filings. You can even use metadata to tag documents by case name and show them dynamically on the dashboard.

#### 7. **Permissions and Security**
   - Ensure the appropriate staff members have access to specific areas of the dashboard based on their role.
   - Use **SharePoint permissions** to restrict access to certain cases or lists as needed. For example, certain sensitive cases may only be viewable by the assigned attorney.

#### 8. **Mobile Access (Optional)**
   - SharePoint's modern sites are mobile-friendly, so your case dashboard will be accessible via mobile devices. You can also use the **SharePoint mobile app** for on-the-go access to your cases and tasks.

### Example Structure of the Dashboard:
```
--------------------------------------------
| Case Dashboard                           |
|------------------------------------------|
| [List of Active Cases]                   |
| Case Name | Client | Status | Start Date |
|------------------------------------------|
| [Upcoming Deadlines]                     |
| Event | Case | Date | Assigned Attorney  |
|------------------------------------------|
| [Task Progress (Tasks Grouped by Case)]  |
| Task | Case | Due Date | Status | Priority|
|------------------------------------------|
| [Recent Documents / Quick Links]         |
--------------------------------------------
```

### Advanced: Power BI Integration
For more advanced reporting (e.g., total number of cases, task completion rates), you can use **Power BI** and connect it to your SharePoint lists. This would allow you to create detailed charts and graphs and display them directly on your dashboard using the Power BI web part.

### Summary
- **SharePoint Lists** store case data, tasks, and events.
- **Custom Views** and **Web Parts** help you visualize the data on your dashboard.
- **Power Automate** enhances functionality with automated reminders and status updates.
- **Permissions** control access to sensitive case information.
