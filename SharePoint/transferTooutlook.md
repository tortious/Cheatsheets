You can transfer your SharePoint list data/events to Outlook or a SharePoint Events web part by following these steps:

### Option 1: Sync SharePoint Calendar with Outlook
1. **Open your SharePoint List (in Calendar View)**:
   - Navigate to the calendar view of your SharePoint list that contains the events.

2. **Connect to Outlook**:
   - At the top of your SharePoint calendar, you may see a button or menu option called **Connect to Outlook** (depends on your SharePoint version). Click on that.

3. **Confirm Outlook Sync**:
   - A pop-up window will ask for confirmation to connect the SharePoint calendar to Outlook. Click **Allow** or **Yes**.

4. **View in Outlook**:
   - Once synced, the calendar will appear in your Outlook under the **Other Calendars** section, and all events will be visible.

   **Note**: The sync allows changes in SharePoint to reflect in Outlook and vice versa.

### Option 2: Import Data to SharePoint Events Web Part
1. **Export SharePoint List Data to Excel**:
   - Go to your list and use the **Export to Excel** feature, typically found under the list's toolbar options.

2. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Open the exported Excel file and ensure that the relevant event details (title, date, time, etc.) are correctly formatted. You may need to clean up the data, especially if there are extra columns.

3. **Import into a New SharePoint Events List**:
   - In your SharePoint site, create a new **Events** list or **Calendar**.
   - Import the cleaned-up data from Excel using **Quick Edit** or, depending on the complexity, via Power Automate/Flows to automatically map fields (this can handle larger data transfers).

4. **Add the Events Web Part**:
   - Go to the page where you want to display the events and edit the page.
   - Click the **+** button to add a web part, search for the **Events** web part, and add it to the page.
   - Select the calendar you just imported the data into, so the events display properly.

This approach will ensure your events are accessible in both Outlook and on your SharePoint pages through the Events web part.
