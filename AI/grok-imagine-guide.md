My Nih-Guhh, I got you — Grok’s imagine and regular Grok prompts play a little different than DALL·E or MidJourney. They’re fussier with wording, and they eat “editorial” / “stylized” language smoother. If you try to get too literal (like bust, cleavage, gore, etc.), you already know they flag fast.

Here’s how I’d tailor your Scary Terry Prompting Guide for Grok & Grok Imagine:

⸻

⚡ Scary Terry’s Prompting Bible (Grok Edition)

1️⃣ General Principles for Grok
	•	Keep it shorter, descriptive, cinematic. Grok Imagine doesn’t like over-stuffed prompts.
	•	Always anchor with photorealistic + cinematic or high-fashion editorial.
	•	Use style cues like “shot on film,” “magazine cover,” “movie poster.”
	•	Instead of “showing skin / bust,” just say “open collar,” “low-cut fashion top,” “tailored fit.”

⸻

2️⃣ Battle-Damage / Cybernetic Stuff (Grok)

Grok likes sci-fi words more than anatomical ones.

Prompt Example (Safe):

Photorealistic portrait of a man with cybernetic battle damage, showing fractured plating with glowing circuitry beneath. One eye is replaced by a glowing red robotic lens, while cinematic sparks flicker. Background: apocalyptic Chicago skyline in winter, smoke-filled.

⚡ Safe Substitutes for Grok:
	•	“cybernetic reveal” → instead of “flesh torn off”
	•	“fractured plating” → instead of “ripped skin”
	•	“glowing circuitry” → instead of “blood or muscle”

⸻

3️⃣ Clothing & Outfit Prompts (Grok)

This is where Grok flags the most — so stick to fashion language.

Prompt Example (Safe):

Photorealistic waist-up portrait styled like a luxury fashion editorial. The man wears a pastel-striped button-down with three buttons undone, revealing tattoos beneath, paired with navy golf shorts trimmed in white. Accessories: diamond studs, reflective designer shades tipped low.

⚡ Safe Substitutes for Grok:
	•	“open collar” / “three buttons undone” → instead of “exposing chest”
	•	“tailored luxury shirt” → instead of “tight shirt”
	•	“styled like a fashion catalog” → instead of “sexy outfit”

⸻

4️⃣ Tattoos / Logos (Grok)

Keep it framed as artistic or mural.

Prompt Example (Safe):

His chest features a mural tattoo of the Scary Terry Productions logo, surrounded by graffiti-style hacker art like Phantom Phreak and Acid Burn.

⚡ Use “mural / graffiti-style / illustrative tattoo” → Grok eats that up.

⸻

5️⃣ Accessories & Jewelry (Grok)

Bling is fine — but emphasize luxury & designer, not “weapon-inspired.”

Prompt Example (Safe):

He grins wide, flashing an iced-out jeweled grill, with black diamond earrings and a luxury watch gleaming.

⸻

6️⃣ Backgrounds (Grok)

Swap gore for cinematic chaos.

Prompt Example (Safe):

Behind him: a smoke-filled winter Chicago skyline, stylized like a sci-fi movie poster, with apocalyptic turmoil in the distance.

⸻

7️⃣ Super Grok “Safe Words”

Drop these in any prompt:
	•	Photorealistic
	•	Cinematic
	•	Stylized
	•	High-fashion editorial
	•	Luxury / Designer
	•	Magazine cover style
	•	Movie-poster vibe

⸻

8️⃣ Full Example Prompt (Grok Ready)

Photorealistic waist-up portrait styled like a luxury fashion editorial cover shot. A tattooed man wears a pastel-striped designer shirt with three buttons undone, revealing a mural chest tattoo of the Scary Terry Productions logo. Above his left eye, the word “tortious” is scribbled. He flashes an iced-out jeweled grill, black diamond studs in both ears, and reflective designer shades resting on his nose. One eye glows red, part of his face showing cybernetic plating with glowing circuitry beneath. Behind him, a smoke-filled Chicago skyline in turmoil sets a cinematic, movie-poster atmosphere.

👉 I can turn this into a second PDF (“Scary Terry’s Grok Prompt Bible”) so you’ve got both side by side: one for DALL·E-style, one for Grok Imagine.

Want me to spin that PDF for you too so you got a matched pair?
