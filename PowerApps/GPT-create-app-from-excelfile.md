To use PowerApps with an Excel file uploaded to SharePoint, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Excel File:
Ensure your Excel file is formatted as a table. PowerApps recognizes tables, so make sure your data is structured accordingly.
Save the Excel file to a SharePoint document library.
2. Create a PowerApp:
Go to PowerApps.
Select Apps from the left-hand navigation, then click + New app to create a new app.
Choose Canvas app for a custom design or Model-driven app if you have a data model in mind.
3. Connect PowerApps to Your Excel File:
In the PowerApps editor, go to the Data section from the left pane.
Click on + Add data and search for "Excel Online (Business)".
Select Excel Online (Business) as the connector.
Choose your SharePoint site and document library where the Excel file is stored.
Navigate to the Excel file and select the table you want to connect to.
4. Design Your App:
After connecting the data source, you can start designing your app.
Use the data (e.g., by adding galleries, forms, or other controls) to display, edit, or input new data.
You can bind these controls to the data from your Excel table.
5. Publish and Share Your App:
Once your app is ready, click on File > Save and then Publish.
You can then share the app with other users within your organization.
6. Use the App:
Users can now access the app through PowerApps, and any changes they make will be reflected in the Excel file stored on SharePoint.
Tips:

Ensure that the SharePoint site and Excel file have proper permissions set, so users can access and modify the data as needed.
Test the app thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the SharePoint-based Excel data.

is there a way I can use office 365 business (specifically sharepoint and/or powerapps) so that I can fill out specific information everytime a new case comes in and when I am done filling in the info, it automatically takes that and turns it into its own sharepoint site?

Yes, you can automate the creation of a SharePoint site for each new case by using a combination of PowerApps, SharePoint, and Power Automate (formerly known as Microsoft Flow). Here's how you can set this up:

1. Design a PowerApp for Data Entry:
Create a PowerApp that serves as a form to collect information for each new case.
This form should include fields like case name, client name, case details, etc.
The data entered into this form can be stored in a SharePoint list, which will serve as a record of all cases.
2. Store Data in a SharePoint List:
Create a SharePoint list where the case information collected via PowerApps will be stored.
This list will act as a database to track all cases and will trigger the site creation process.
3. Set Up a Power Automate Flow to Create a SharePoint Site:
In Power Automate, create a new flow that triggers when a new item is added to your SharePoint list (where the case data is stored).
Use the "Create SharePoint Site" action to automatically generate a new SharePoint site for each case. You'll typically want to create a site based on a template, like a communication site or a team site.
Use dynamic content from the SharePoint list (like the case name) to customize the siteâ€™s URL and title.
You can also include additional steps in your flow to:
Add default document libraries or lists to the new site.
Assign permissions to specific users.
Send a notification email with the link to the newly created site.
4. Enhance the SharePoint Site:
Optionally, you can configure the new SharePoint sites to automatically include templates for case management, such as folders, document libraries, or lists tailored to your practice.
5. Publish and Use the Solution:
Publish the PowerApp so you or others in your firm can enter new cases.
When a new case is entered, the Power Automate flow will trigger, creating a new SharePoint site for that case.
This setup allows you to streamline the process of case management by automating site creation, ensuring that each new case is neatly organized with its own dedicated SharePoint site.
