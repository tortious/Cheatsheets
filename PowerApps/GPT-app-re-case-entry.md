is there a way I can use office 365 business (specifically sharepoint and/or powerapps) so that I can fill out specific information everytime a new case comes in and when I am done filling in the info, it automatically takes that and turns it into its own sharepoint site?

Yes, you can automate the creation of a SharePoint site for each new case by using a combination of PowerApps, SharePoint, and Power Automate (formerly known as Microsoft Flow). Here's how you can set this up:

1. Design a PowerApp for Data Entry:
Create a PowerApp that serves as a form to collect information for each new case.
This form should include fields like case name, client name, case details, etc.
The data entered into this form can be stored in a SharePoint list, which will serve as a record of all cases.
2. Store Data in a SharePoint List:
Create a SharePoint list where the case information collected via PowerApps will be stored.
This list will act as a database to track all cases and will trigger the site creation process.
3. Set Up a Power Automate Flow to Create a SharePoint Site:
In Power Automate, create a new flow that triggers when a new item is added to your SharePoint list (where the case data is stored).
Use the "Create SharePoint Site" action to automatically generate a new SharePoint site for each case. You'll typically want to create a site based on a template, like a communication site or a team site.
Use dynamic content from the SharePoint list (like the case name) to customize the siteâ€™s URL and title.
You can also include additional steps in your flow to:
Add default document libraries or lists to the new site.
Assign permissions to specific users.
Send a notification email with the link to the newly created site.
4. Enhance the SharePoint Site:
Optionally, you can configure the new SharePoint sites to automatically include templates for case management, such as folders, document libraries, or lists tailored to your practice.
5. Publish and Use the Solution:
Publish the PowerApp so you or others in your firm can enter new cases.
When a new case is entered, the Power Automate flow will trigger, creating a new SharePoint site for that case.
This setup allows you to streamline the process of case management by automating site creation, ensuring that each new case is neatly organized with its own dedicated SharePoint site.
